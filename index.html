    <h1>Hello!</h1>
      <p>I'm currently a PhD candidate at the <a href="ucdavis.edu">Univeristy of California, Davis</a> studying psychology. My focus is on the cognitive neuroscience of vision and attention. I typically use eye-tracking &amp; fMRI in my work.</p>
      <p>My favorite languages for science are R and python.</p>
      <p>I have a dog named Pacino who is very good at defending the house from friends. He'll listen to me play guitar, harmonica, and piano sometimes. Mostly, he's waiting for meat to fall on the ground somehow.</p>
      <p>While I currently live in Davis, CA, I completed my undergrad work at UC Santa Barbara after starting out at the College of San Mateo. I grew up in San Bruno, CA on the street that blew up.</p>
